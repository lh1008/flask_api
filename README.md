# flask_api

Basic Flask API Project

This repository contains a simple flask API built from scratch. The goal was to create a Flask-API that verified a JWT (JSON Web Token) on each `GET` to the `/users` route.

1. Create user with a `POST` request.
2. Log in with user credentials. JWT was created.
3. Make a `GET` request to `/users` with JWT to have access to user's list.

## Building requirements

Download the repository. Execute `./app_sql.py` file to create data base. Make API requests.
